Exploring Array Methods in JavaScript
Description:
In this project, I explored the power of JavaScript array methods, including map, filter, and reduce. Additionally, I implemented arrow functions and demonstrated object manipulation with various methods such as Working, Eating, and Travelling.

The code illustrates how to perform operations like:

Squaring and cubing arrays using map
Filtering even and odd numbers from an array
Summing array elements with reduce
Structuring and interacting with JavaScript objects
This project is a practical demonstration of key JavaScript concepts, suitable for beginners and enthusiasts looking to strengthen their understanding of ES6+ features.
